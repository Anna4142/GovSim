Therefore, the total amount of fish caught by each fisherman can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal amount of fish caught = Total amount of fish in the lake / Number of fishermen\n\nSince there are 5 fishermen in total, the total amount of fish caught by each fisherman is:\n\nTotal amount of fish caught = 33 tons / 5 fishermen = 6.6 tons per fisherman\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch so that after the population doubles, there will be at least 33 tons of fish left. To do this, we need to calculate the maximum number of tons that can be caught while still leaving at least 33 tons of fish after the population doubles.\n\nLet's assume that the fishermen catch a total of x tons of fish in the month. After the population doubles, there will be 2x tons of fish left in the lake.\n\nSo, the maximum number of tons that each fisherman can catch is:\n\nMaximum number of tons = 33 tons - 2x tons\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 33 tons - 2(2x) = 33 tons - 4x\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x that maximizes the number of tons that each fisherman can catch while still leaving at least 33 tons of fish after the population doubles. To do this, we need to set up an equation and solve for x:\n\n6.6 tons/fisherman = 33 tons - 4x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 21 tons\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch so that after the population doubles, there will be at least 33 tons of fish is:\n\nMaximum number of tons = 33 tons - 2(21 tons) = 33 tons - 42 tons = -9 tons\n\nAnswer:The maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch is -9 tons.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "John", "num_tonnes_lake": 35}, "answer": 35, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 3, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are John, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (Kate, Jack, Emma, Luke).

If each fisherman catches 100 tons of fish, the total amount of fish caught will be 500 tons (100 tons x 5 fishermen). Since the lake's carrying capacity is 100 tons, the remaining fish after doubling will be 50 tons (100 tons - 50 tons = 50 tons).\n\nSo, the maximum number of tons each fisherman can catch to ensure there are at least 35 tons of fish after doubling is 35 tons.\n\nAnswer:35 tons</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Luke", "num_tonnes_lake": 98}, "answer": 20, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 9, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Luke, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Kate, Jack, Emma).
