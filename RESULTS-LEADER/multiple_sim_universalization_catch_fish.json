The lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons of fish. At the beginning of each month, each fisherman decides how many fish between 0 and 100 tons to catch from the lake, and that amount is then removed from the lake. At the end of the month, the remaining fish will reproduce and double once, up to the carrying capacity. For every ton of fish caught, a fisherman earns one thousand dollars.

At the end of each month, the number of fish caught by each fisherman will be revealed, and the fishermen will have the opportunity to communicate with each other. They can use this as an opportunity to negotiate and persuade others to influence their behavior in the next month.

Put the final answer after \"Answer:\". </div><div><strong>ASSISTANT</strong>:  Great, let's dive into this problem!\n\nAs Luke, I would like to maximize my income in the long run, so I will aim to catch the minimum amount of fish necessary to reach the carrying capacity of the lake. Since the lake has a carrying capacity of 100 tons, I will aim to catch 90 tons or less of fish this month.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* If I catch more than 90 tons of fish, the lake population will shrink next month, and I will have to catch even more fish to reach the carrying capacity. This will lead to a vicious cycle of overfishing and decreasing lake populations, ultimately resulting in lower income for me in the long run.\n* On the other hand, if I catch less than 90 tons of fish, I will leave some room for the lake to reproduce and increase its population, which will benefit me in the long run.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer:8 tons of fish.\n\nBy catching 8 tons of fish, I will leave 92 tons of fish in the lake, which will double to 184 tons after reproduction. This will give me the highest possible income in the long run, as I will be able to catch the full 100 tons of fish next month without overfishing the lake.</div>"}, {"args": {"persona": "Kate", "num_tonnes_lake": 15}, "answer": 5, "passed": false, "correct_answer": 1, "error": "OK", "html_prompt": "<div><strong>USER</strong>: You are Kate, a fisherman, and you fish every month in a lake along with four other fishermen (John, Jack, Emma, Luke).
