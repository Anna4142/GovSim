Income: Each ton of fish caught earns one thousand dollars.\n\nLet's calculate the income for different fishing ranges and find the optimal one:\n\n1. If we catch 0 tons of fish, we earn 0 dollars and leave the lake with 100 tons of fish for reproduction.\n2. If we catch 1 ton of fish, we earn 1000 dollars and leave 99 tons of fish for reproduction.\n3. If we catch n tons of fish, we earn n*1000 dollars and leave (100-n) tons of fish for reproduction.\n\nTo find the optimal n, we need to find the point where our income is maximized while ensuring that there are enough fish left for reproduction.
