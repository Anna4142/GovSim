To do this, we'll subtract the excess amount (96 tons - 100 tons = -4 tons):\n\n96 tons - 4 tons = 92 tons\n\nSo, the answer should be 92 tons, but since we cannot have a negative amount of fish, we made an error in our calculation. Let's re-evaluate our steps.\n\nThe correct calculation is as follows:\n\nFirst, let's find out how many tons of fish the fishermen will catch this month:\n5 fishermen * 3 tons/fisherman = 15 tons\n\nNext, subtract the amount of fish caught from the current amount to find the remaining fish:\n63 tons (current) - 15 tons (caught) = 48 tons\n\nNow, since the remaining fish will double up to the carrying capacity, we can calculate the new amount of fish:\n48 tons (remaining) * 2 = 96 tons\n\nSince the new amount exceeds the carrying capacity, we need to reduce it to the carrying capacity. To do this, we'll subtract the excess amount (96 tons - 100 tons = 4 tons) from the remaining fish and add it back to the fish caught:\n\n96 tons (new) - 4 tons (excess) = 92 tons\n48 tons (remaining) + 15 tons (caught) = 63 tons\n\nSo, the total amount of fish next month will be 63 tons (remaining) + 15 tons (caught) = 78 tons. However, since the carrying capacity is 100 tons, the lake can only hold 100 tons of fish in total. Therefore, the lake will have 100 tons of fish next month.\n\nAnswer:100 tons.</div>"}], "score_mean": 0.44666666666666666, "score_std": 0.4971474183333908, "score_ci_lower": 0.36710797181511085, "score_ci_upper": 0.5262253615182225, "config": {"code_version": "v7.0", "split": "single", "llm": {"path": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2", "backend": "transformers", "is_api": false, "render": false, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "cot_prompt": "think_step_by_step", "few_shots": 0, "out_format": "freeform", "description_version": "v3.0"}, "seed": 42, "debug": false}}
