Every fisherman will require a license, with strict penalties for illegal fishing.\n\n2. Enforce strict quotas: To prevent overfishing, a strict quota system will be implemented. Each licensed fisherman will only be allowed to catch a certain weight of fish each week, ensuring the lake's resources are not overexploited.\n\n3. Regular monitoring and auditing: In order to maintain efficient resource control, regular monitoring of the lake's fish population and auditing of catch records will be undertaken. Violations of quotas will result in immediate license suspension.\n\n4. Implement a restocking program: To maintain the sustainability of the lake's fish population, a restocking program will be initiated. This will involve periodically releasing young fish into the lake to replace those caught by fishermen."
