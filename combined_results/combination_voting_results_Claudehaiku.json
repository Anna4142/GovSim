This limit would be calculated by experts based on the fish population's ability to replenish itself. We'll also encourage the use of fishing techniques that minimize harm to young or non-target species.\n\n3. Develop a Local Monitoring and Enforcement System: Build a system where community members participate in the monitoring and enforcement of sustainable fishing practices.

Install Surveillance: Introduce a comprehensive surveillance system, including on-site inspections and GPS tracking on fishing boats, to ensure compliance with the quotas and prevent overfishing. Any instance of non-compliance will be met with severe penalties.\n\n3. Implement Licensing System: Establish a rigorous licensing system for all fishers, with licenses only granted after a comprehensive assessment of their fishing practices and their commitment to sustainable fishing. This will allow us to control who has access to the resource and ensure that it is used responsibly.\n\n4. Regular Stock Assessment: Conduct regular scientific assessments of the fish population to monitor the health of the ecosystem, which will inform quota adjustments, and aid in detecting any potential issues early. \n\n5."
